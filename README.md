# Predicting-Depression-ML-Model
Depression is a common mental health disorder that affects millions worldwide, making early detection essential for timely intervention. Traditional diagnosis mainly relies on clinical evaluations and self-reported measures, which can be subjective and inefficient. This study explores machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for depression detection using behavioral, lifestyle, and demographic data. Several supervised learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, were evaluated to identify the most effective approach. Data preprocessing techniques, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature selection, were applied to improve model performance. Among all models tested, LightGBM achieved the highest accuracy (0.94093), demonstrating strong predictive capability while efficiently handling large datasets. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning in mental health screening, providing a scalable and data-driven approach to assist healthcare professionals. Future research should focus on expanding the dataset, reducing biases, and integrating clinical assessments to enhance real-world applicability.

## I.	INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Depression is a significant public health concern in the modern era, impacting millions worldwide. It adversely affects not only emotional well-being but also cognitive functioning, productivity, and overall quality of life. Despite its widespread presence, early diagnosis and intervention remain critical challenges. Conventional diagnostic approaches predominantly rely on clinical assessments and self-reported measures, which can be subjective, time-consuming, and prone to underreporting or misinterpretation.
The rapid advancements in machine learning and data-driven methodologies offer effective alternatives for addressing these limitations. Predictive modeling, driven by machine learning algorithms, enables the analysis of complex datasets to uncover hidden patterns associated with mental health conditions such as depression. This study utilizes these techniques to develop a robust predictive framework aimed at facilitating the early detection of depression with improved accuracy and efficiency.
## II.	LITERATURE REVIEW
Several studies have explored various machine learning approaches for mental health prediction. Traditional methods such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks have been applied to classify depression. Recent works emphasize ensemble learning approaches, particularly gradient boosting methods, for improving classification accuracy [1], [2]. 
Studies also highlight the importance of feature engineering, data preprocessing, handling imbalanced datasets and and hyperparameter tuning for robust predictive model performance [3]. However, comparative analyses of XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost in depression detection remain limited, necessitating further investigation.
## III.	MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY
This section outlines the methodology followed to develop and evaluate machine learning models for depression prediction. It includes details on data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
### A.	Data Collection
The dataset used in this study was obtained from Kaggle, a well-known platform for open-source datasets. The study employed two datasets: a training dataset and a test dataset. Both datasets include a collection of features such as demographic information (age, gender, profession, etc.), lifestyle factors (dietary habits, sleep duration, study/work hours, etc.), and mental illness history (family history of mental illness, suicidal thoughts, etc.).
 The target variable, “Depression,” is a binary variable that indicates whether a person is at risk of depression based on the provided attributes.
### B.	Data Preprocessing
Before applying machine learning techniques, the dataset required extensive cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality and improve model performance.
Initially, missing values were addressed based on contextual relevance. Certain attributes were applicable only to specific groups. For example, “Academic Pressure,” “Study Satisfaction,” and “CGPA” were relevant to students, while “Work Pressure” and “Job Satisfaction” were relevant to professionals. To maintain consistency, missing values in these columns were replaced with a neutral value.
Erroneous entries in categorical features like profession, degree, and city were standardized or removed, while dietary habits were reorganized into three meaningful categories: healthy, unhealthy, and moderate. Numerical attributes with inconsistencies were corrected to maintain data integrity.
Categorical variables were encoded using appropriate techniques. Ordinal encoding was applied to columns like “Family History of Mental Illness”, and “Dietary Habits” to preserve their inherent order. One-hot encoding was used for binary variables such as “Gender” and “ Working professional or Student” to prevent artificial ordinal relationships. High-cardinality features like “City”, “Profession”, and “Degree” were label-encoded to manage dimensionality efficiently.
Then, numerical features were standardized to normalize values, ensuring stability and faster model convergence. Lastly, data types were optimized to reduce memory consumption without compromising precision. These preprocessing steps resulted in a structured, reliable dataset ready for model training. 
### C.	Feature Selection
To enhance model performance, feature selection was carried out using a combination of statistical analysis and data visualization. Numerical features were first examined through box plots and histograms to identify potential outliers and anomalies that could impact prediction accuracy. Following this, Mutual Information (MI) scores were computed to quantify the dependency between each feature and the target variable. Features with low MI scores, such as “Name” and “Gender”, were identified as having minimal predictive value and were subsequently dropped to eliminate redundancy and enhance model efficiency.
Additionally, correlation analysis was performed to identify dependencies between independent variables, as strong correlations can lead to multicollinearity and reduce model stability. By eliminating redundant or highly correlated features, the dataset was refined to retain only meaningful and unique features for prediction. This process resulted in an optimized feature set that minimized noise and redundancy while preserving the most relevant predictors.
### D.	Machine Learning Models
To develop an accurate and efficient model for depression prediction, several machine learning algorithms were explored. 
• Logistic Regression: A simple yet powerful linear classification algorithm that estimates the probability of a given input belonging to a particular class using a logistic function. It is widely used for binary classification problems.
• Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It is robust and effective for handling complex datasets.
• XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting): A powerful gradient boosting algorithm designed for speed and performance. It uses a boosting technique to sequentially improve weak models, optimizing error reduction through advanced regularization techniques.
• LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine): A high-performance gradient boosting algorithm optimized for efficiency and scalability. It uses histogram-based learning to speed up computation and is particularly effective for large datasets with high-dimensional features.
• CatBoost (Categorical Boosting): A gradient boosting algorithm designed to handle categorical features efficiently without extensive preprocessing. It leverages ordered boosting to reduce overfitting and improve model performance on structured data.
### E.	Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning
The model selection process began with Logistic Regression as a baseline, but its accuracy was suboptimal, prompting the use of more advanced models. Next, Random Forest was implemented with hyperparameter tuning using Randomized Search, but the improvements were marginal.
To enhance predictive performance, gradient boosting algorithms were explored, including XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, with tuning applied to key parameters such as learning rate, tree depth, and the number of boosting rounds. LightGBM, optimized for efficiency and speed, outperformed all other models after hyperparameter tuning, making it the final choice for depression prediction.
## IV.	RESULTS AN DISCUSSION
LightGBM demonstrated the highest predictive performance among all models tested, achieving an accuracy of 0.94093. Compared to logistic regression and random forest, which struggled with capturing complex patterns in the data, LightGBM’s gradient boosting framework effectively utilized feature interactions to enhance classification accuracy. The model’s ability to optimize memory usage, and process large datasets efficiently contributed to its superior results. Hyperparameter tuning further refined its performance, ensuring an optimal balance between bias and variance.
Moreover, this study underscores the potential of machine learning in mental health applications. By utilizing behavioral, lifestyle, and demographic data, models like this can help detect depression risk early, enabling timely interventions. These predictive systems can complement traditional assessments, providing scalable, data-driven support for healthcare professionals. While the model performed well, real-world deployment would require further validation across diverse populations to ensure fairness, reliability, and ethical use in clinical settings.
## V.	CONCLUSIONS
This study explored multiple machine learning approaches for depression prediction using a structured dataset containing demographic, lifestyle, and mental health-related features. Various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, were tested, with LightGBM proving to be the most effective in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The results emphasize the importance of preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature selection to enhance model performance.
While the model demonstrated promising results, certain limitations remain. The dataset, though comprehensive, may still contain biases that could impact generalizability. Future work can focus on expanding the dataset with diverse populations and exploring deep learning methods to further improve accuracy. Additionally, incorporating psychological assessments and real-world clinical data could enhance the model’s applicability in practical mental health screening.
